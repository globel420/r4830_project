- 0x2A language (05-frame family)

Verified ACK pattern:

  - 052a7a68000c

CHECKPOINT 2026-02-08T20:17:23Z
- Hub Save Tracking added (ACK/NO_ACK/REJECTED/FAILED/UNMAPPED)
- Last unmapped Hub save key fixed:
  - charging_statistics_zero -> 06130000000013
- Current rule for live validation:
  - RX counter increasing + Save Tracking shows ACK = command path is working.

CHECKPOINT 2026-02-08T20:32:00Z
- Web Bluetooth desktop app added:
  - /Users/globel/r4830_project/controller/frontend/index.html
  - /Users/globel/r4830_project/controller/frontend/app.js
  - /Users/globel/r4830_project/controller/frontend/styles.css
- Web app supports mapped controls, ACK-aware save tracking, telemetry summary, keepalive loop.
- Run:
  - cd /Users/globel/r4830_project/controller/frontend
  - python3 -m http.server 8787
  - open http://localhost:8787 in desktop Chrome/Edge

CHECKPOINT 2026-02-08T20:36:00Z
- Web app now includes candidate name/password actions:
  - rename charger -> cmd 0x1E ASCII frame
  - set BLE password -> cmd 0x1B ASCII frame

CHECKPOINT 2026-02-08T20:42:00Z
- Web app language selector expanded to 3 options:
  - English
  - Chinese (Simplified)
  - Chinese (Traditional, candidate)
